# pi
calculating pi with python man!
So this is one of my first prodjects on here. there is a slow version that is not optimised. and theres a fast version. run either one you get met with the simple gui, it also takes a save every 200 digets to a text file (either pi.txt or pi2.txt depending on what script you run) thanks for checking this out
